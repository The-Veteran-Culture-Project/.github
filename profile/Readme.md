## About Us

We aim to help Veterans integrate back into civilian society, find their true self, and work towards finding solutions to our growing mental health needs.

__Ethos__: Open Source | Ran By Veterans | Not For Profit

__Impact__: The Veteran Culture Project aims to gather stories and data for a documentary that delves into the present state of Veteran Culture and identity. Following the documentary, the project may transition into ongoing research.

__Data__: Individual survey assessments will be protected, and the results will be aggregated in a generalized manner.

__Limitations__: We acknowledge the physical and mental health risks associated with identity and culture. Our survey is not a perfect model and will undergo continuous evaluation and improvements with input from fellow Veterans and healthcare professionals.
